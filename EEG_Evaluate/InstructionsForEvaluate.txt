Instructions for evaluate.py or eval_mtest.py 
--Anna Namyst, CNL Lab, Spring 2014

Introduction: 
Evaluate.py was designed to evaluate participant responses in EEG, MEG, and MRI experiments from Matlab logs for WordPres and SentEEG/SentMEG experiments.

Catalogue of Available Scripts:

	*EEG Studies
		EEG_evaluate_mtest.py
		
	*MEG Studies 
		Narwhal: eval_Narwhal.py, eval_sp.py
		LindyHop: eval_LH.py
	(MEG trigger codes vary by Experiment, so the scripts are currently tailored for each 
	study. Eventually, there will be a MEG_evaluate_mtest.py available. For now, choose 
	one of the existing scripts and adjust accordingly.)

Walkthrough:

1. Set-up
	a.Make sure that your Matlab logs are in the proper location:
		For EEG studies:
			filepath= '/Users/Shared/Experiments/YOUREXPERIMENT/data/logs'
			#Future update: ...../matlab_logs
		For MEG studies:
			filepath = '/Users/Shared/Experiments/YOUREXPERIMENT/data/YOURSUBJECT/logs'

	b. Create a scoring key specific to your trigger codes and response codes.
		Currently (Spring 2014) this key must live in the same folder as the evaluate 
		script. Eventually, the key may be called from the Experiment directory like 
		"CondCodes" for MEG processing.
		
2. Running the script
	a. The arguments you must provide are as follows:
		--subjID: e.g. ELK_S02
		--expt: Your experiment and the name of your Experiment in the "Shared/Experiments" folder
		--exptkey
		--paradigm
